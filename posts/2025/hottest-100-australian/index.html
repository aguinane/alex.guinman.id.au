<p>I had a massive shortlist for this one, so added a few rules to narrow it down.</p>
<ul>
<li>At least one song from each decade for Top 5 - broke this one for the 2020s since it&#39;s not over yet (and whilst a few made my shortlist there were better choices in the other decades).</li>
<li>Stick to the short list - broke this one for The Cat Empire (as whilst Hello made sense, they have better songs then The Car Song and Wolves).</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Cold Chisel - Khe Sahn (70s)</li>
<li>Crowded House - Don&#39;t Dream It&#39;s Over (80s)</li>
<li>The Living End - Prisoner of Society (90s)</li>
<li>The Cat Empire - The Wine Song (00s)</li>
<li>Ball Park Music - She Only Loves Me When I&#39;m There (10s)</li>
<li>The Whitlams - No Aphrodisiac (90s)</li>
<li>Gotye - Learnalilgivinanlovin (00s)</li>
<li>Bluejuice - Act Your Age (10s)</li>
<li>Missy Higgins - The Special Two (00s)</li>
<li>The Preatures - Is This How You Feel? (10s)</li>
</ol>
