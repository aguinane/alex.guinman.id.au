<p>Went out to some pubs in Zürich last night.</p>
<p>Had a very expensive rum cocktail which was nothing on just normal plain rum, some relatively cheap beers, and found some Famous Grouss, but was talked into buying a rum and orange juice thing which was okay. But I took a photo of the grous for Mr Hooper and Tommy P. The drinks were real expensive but, even for clubs.</p>
<p>The pub where we got the beers was really cool, had lightbulbs everywhere on the roof, played good music (Little Yellow Spider for example) and had a cool vibe.</p>
<p>Then we experienced some Swiss culture (I was out with a german and swiss guy) and bought a cheeseburger from McDonalds.</p>
