I originally started this blog as **Tales From Turgi** when I was living in [Switzerland](/tags/switzerland) in 2010.

Since then, I have tried to update it when ever I [travel](/categories/travel), and sometimes for [other things](/categories/misc).

It is mostly a reference for me to document and look back at things.

Other places you can find me on the net:

**The Site**

This site is generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted with [Github](https://github.com/aguinane/blog) and [Netfliy](https://www.netlify.com/).

It originally was on [Blogger](http://talesfromturgi.blogspot.com/), then I changed to [Wordpress](http://alexguinane.wordpress.com). I then changed again to building a static site with [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) but found generating the site was too slow.
