One part of our block that we were not sure what to do with was the back bit as there is quite a drop to the house behind.

It started to look a bit more manageable after the earthworks and a retaining wall was put in.

The weeds soon got a bit intense and we were sick of jumping up and down so over Christmas I got Dad to help me put in some stairs.

Adding some rocks to help add some layers was the next job.

Next was carting in woodchip to try and keep the weeds under control.

We still had the silt barrier installed from the builders, so we swapped that over for some extra timber sleepers to stop the soil falling under the fence.

I got Dad to help me again and we finished the stairs.

Then paid some landscapers to add a garden bed on the other side.

And finally getting some plants to establish.
