2020 continues to be an eventful year, with both of my grandmas recently passing away less than a month apart. Since the Rockhampton Morning Bulletin is no longer in print to publish obituaries, I thought it would be worth preserving a copy of both the funeral notices here for posterity.

I've also saved a copy of the Eulogy for both [Marie](/pages/eulogy-marie-guinane/) and [Isabel](/pages/eulogy-isabel-wheatland/).

This photo of them both at tennis club was a nice suprise to come across.
