Last weekend we went to Lamington National Park [again](/posts/2014/2014-04-22-lamington-national-park/), however just camped at the normal camp sites no hike-in camping.

We went the long way to get there so we could detour past Allora and see if the Sunflowers were in season for Bec. They weren't really but there was one field at the racecourse.

We went to O'Reilly's last time so would have been good to go to the Binna Burra end instead, but Darcy told us of the Treetop Walk. We saw signs for it last time and tried to find it, but somehow walked straight past it. It was pretty fun climbing to the top of the tree, so was definitely worth coming back. Turns out it was super easy to find from the car park, but was not well signed when coming from the opposite direction.

The camp sites were pretty good, almost like a caravan park as we were so close to the cafe and BBQ areas. Much different to the last time we camped.

On Sunday we did an actual hike, heading to Picnic Rock which is the way we went last time. Jaimee, Christian and I went a bit past here and turned off and did the last part of the Box Forest Circuit. The Box Forest Falls themselves were spectacular and probably the highlight of the trip. It was closed in on both sides by cliff and the flowing water created a wind tunnel which just pushed mist downstream.
