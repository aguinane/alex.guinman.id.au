Mik and Michelle's wedding was at Kommune Resort in Keramas. But the rooms were all booked by the time we had leave approved, so we ended up staying at the surf camp next door which was a great little spot.

The free breakfast came with a great view.

The beach itself was pretty awesome, although it had shallow reef so no swimming. I went for one surf at high tide and didn't die so pretty happy with that. The beach was covered in black volcanic sand.

The main reason for going to Keramas was of course [Mik and Michelle's Wedding](/posts/2016/2016-12-26/mik-and-michelles-wedding/). After the wedding, we had one more day of relaxing at the beach before we headed home.

The flight back seemed a long one. We flew past Toowoomba on the way back, which made the 2 hour drive the next morning a bit annoying - was much faster flying over in the plane.
