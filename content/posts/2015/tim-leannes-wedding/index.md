We went to Tim & Leanne's Wedding at [Topiaries](http://www.topiaries.com.au/) on Saturday. The ceremony was beautiful and the reception heaps of fun.

It was a pretty hectic drive down to Brisbane driving through the middle of the Ex-Tropical Cyclone, but wasn't too bad and cleared up in the afternoon for the ceremony. Unfortunately there were a few people from Rocky that couldn't make it down because the airport was closed.
