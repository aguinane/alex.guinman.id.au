We flew out from Christchurch and so got a rental car to drive from Queenstown, staying the night at Tekapo.

Lake Pukaki was as awesome as I remembered it, and we stopped and got out to skip some stones. Lake Tekapo itself seemed less appealing for some reason, it seemed like the water level was lower maybe. The snow tubing was still there though, so that was fun.

Last time I went to New Zealand we didn't see much of Christchurch besides the airport, so I was keen to see the city. It is still pretty abandoned and derelict from the earthquake years ago though, so there was nowhere really to eat and so we went to the beach for lunch. There was road works everywhere and it's crazy how much construction was going on so long after the fact.
