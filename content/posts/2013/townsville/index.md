My next rotation for work is field, and as the training in Toowoomba was cancelled, I had to go to Townsville for a couple of weeks to do the training up there. Luckily Rachael was able to come up on the weekend and we got to go see The Cat Empire play at Magnetic Island, amongst other site seeing.
