![Top of Tabletop](tabletop.jpg)

Went for a jog up tabletop, and took some photos. These photosphere shots even look cool in 2D. You can look at it street view style on G+ [here](https://plus.google.com/photos/112466174789327643543/albums/5881726813888767585/5884304948539185186?pid=5884304948539185186&oid=112466174789327643543).
