In 2012 my friend Jan visited from Switzerland and I did a post
[Sightseeing at Home](/posts/2012/sightseeing-at-home/) and I showed him some of the tourist places around town. Rachael's sister Lauren was visiting after living in the UK for over 2 years, and so I thought I'd do another post on more Rockhampton tourist things we did this year.

## Capricorn Caves

When we were up at Christmas, Rachael wanted to go see the Summer Solstice Tour at the [Capricorn Caves](http://capricorncaves.com.au/). The solsitce part was cool, but not really worth going specially for. I would be keen to do the adventure caving again, as it was really fun when I did it years ago.

## Stony Creek

There had been a bit of rain, so we went up to [Stony Creek](https://goo.gl/maps/TGJPWD1ZqjR2) for a swim. The water was nice but we got eaten alive by mozzies.

## Great Keppel Island

The main thing we had planned for our visit was to go to Great Keppel Island. We went with a new ferry company called Keppel Konnections and got meal deal and free SUP hire. We thought Lauren was terrible at stand up paddle boards as it was her first time, but turns out her SUP didn't have a fin. Was still fun though.

Putney Beach was still wrecked from the Cyclone, and Hideaway and the rental hut were very close to the ocean.

Lauren bought a cheap snorkel, so we went around to Shelving Beach to the reef. We saw a tree snake on the way but it was a nice hike.

The tide was too far in so the reef was a good distance out and a bit too deep to see properly.

You could still see fish even just on the rocks off the beach.

## Rockhampton Zoo

We went to the zoo to see the new [baby chimp](https://www.rockhamptonregion.qld.gov.au/AboutCouncil/News-and-announcements/Latest-News/Rockhampton-Zoo-welcomes-birth-of-first-baby-Chimpanzee). We realised how awesome it is for a free zoo, and how we took it for granted when we lived there.
