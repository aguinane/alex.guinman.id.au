![Rockhampton Flood](p1060534.jpg)

So the reason why I had so much trouble getting home was because of the floods. So here are some photos and links about it.

This is why my flight was cancelled (it got higher than that):

And NASA had some satellite images that show just how much water there was during and after:

With the airport underwater and the highway and railway closed to the south, it cut down my transport options, but it wasn't completely isolated like the media said. You could still get in through from the north through Mackay, or by boat from Gladstone on the Freedom Fast Cats like I did.
