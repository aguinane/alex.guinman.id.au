![YE Fell In](ye_fellin.jpg)

The weather was slightly improved once we got to the mainland, and were protected by Twofold Bay. We went ashore at Eden and went to visit the Eden Whale Museum, where they keep the skeleton of [Old Tom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Tom_%28killer_whale%29), a killer whale that helped the fishermen lure in other whales and would share in the kill - eating the tongue and leaving the rest for the fishermen.

Somehow at the Dock waiting to get taken back to the ship I fell in the harbour, causing much amusement for everyone present.

That afternoon we had elections for Command Day - the 24 hours in which the youth crew is given full control over the ship. We got everyone to nominate for the positions they wanted, had a silent vote for each position. I was elected watch officer for "Munchy Watch". Munchy being the nickname of Captain Damien before he was the captain.

After the elections we had a movie night, and we were shown a black and white video about sailing that was truly incredible footage. Probably we had more respect for what we were seeing as we were on a tall ship at the time, but it truly was some incredible footage and insane weather that they sailed through. At one point the captain (who narrates it) mentions two of the guys on screen that were lost overboard a few days later, and moves on like it was nothing. I will probably track it down in a few years to watch again.
