Once again finding ten songs to vote for has been a challenge. Normally it is because I have too many songs to choose from. This year I have been a bit slack with listening to new music, so the challenge was filling the ten slots with songs I felt deserved it, whilst not voting for the same artist more than once.

I'm sure when I see the final list there will be plenty of songs that may have deserved my vote that I didn't consider, but in any case I am happy with the following ten for now, so here they are.

**Gotye - [Somebody That I Used To Know](http://vimeo.com/26028186)**
This is clearly going to take out the number 1 spot. I remember when Sarah used to tell me to turn that "weird shit" off when I used to play Like Drawing Blood. Good on him for making a pop hit.

**The Beards - [You Should Consider Having Sex With a Bearded Man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJkLH4uZ73M)**
I am a sucker for musically awesome novelty bands.

**Busby Marou â€“ [Underlying Message](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-KYLJlhb0)**
They were probably even more impressive then Birds of Tokyo when I saw them at the Western. Good to see a local band making it relatively big.

**Tim Minchin - [Pope Song](http://vimeo.com/11338327)**
I remember having an argument with someone at work (when I worked at K-mart) about swearing and how it is wrong because it says so in the bible. This song perfectly sums up my thoughts on the matter. I wasn't expecting this to chart, but considering none of Tim Minchin's new songs were listed in the song list I guess not even some of the less controversial one's will feature either, which is a shame.

**Bluejuice - [Act Your Age](http://vimeo.com/30294624)**
I have always liked their recordings, but I was a bit dissapointed in Bluejuice when I saw the at Big Day Out a few years ago. At the Oxy Street party last week they changed my mind though, and this song went off live.

**Nero - [Me & You](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE47er6qnqg)**
I don't know why I like this song, but I do.

**Boy & Bear - [Feeding Line](http://vimeo.com/28277640)**

**The Black Keys - [Lonely Boy](http://vimeo.com/32543029)**

**Ball Park Music -[ It's Nice To Be Alive](http://vimeo.com/32608568)**

**Intermashional First Class - [All I Know](http://vimeo.com/13974136) {Ft. Eagle And The Worm/Hypnotic Brass Ensemble/Juiceboxxx}**
My actual vote is for Eagle and the Worm - All I Know, but this was technically released in 2010.
