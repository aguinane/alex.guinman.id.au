![After the race.](mtbo.jpg) After the race.

So on Sunday I joined Bully, Tom and Tim on a free Mountain Bike Orienteering Come and Try event. The other three boys have been really into the mountain biking of late and have done a couple of adventure races.

Bully let me use his spare bike and we embarked on a leisurely 20km ride through the forest. As the start our expectation of a trail was very different to the makers of our map, and so we repeatedly rode past the turn off for the first check point. However, once we realised that a barely visible goat track was represented as a trail on the map we were fine.

Considering my lack of exercise in recent months, I found the whole thing quite easy, although I was clearly slowing down the other guys towards the end. We still ended up beating two other guys that kept over-taking us but then somehow getting lost and getting to each checkpoint after us.

Overall it was a pretty fun day, and we came and gave it a try. None of us really enjoyed it enough to want to join the club, as the race itself wasn't any more fun then it would be to go for a ride in the area and find your own tracks. The other 2 times I have been with the boys to Daisy Hill and Bunya and just rode the trails (for free) were equally as fun and more leisurely.
