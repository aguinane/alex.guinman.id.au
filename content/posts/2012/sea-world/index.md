Tom scored us some cheap 3 park super pass season tickets from Energex, so Rachael and I hit up Sea World this weekend. Not too much has changed since last time I went there. They do have Emperor Penguins now, which were fun to watch.

There is also now a Dinosaur Island, which I don't see the relevance of in a water park but they did have some cool fossils. The main display had animatronic dinosaurs similar to Jurassic Park, but I was pleased to see there inside display had more correct displays where they were all covered in feathers and weird looking.

In case you have no idea what I am on about, this is [what they now think a Velociraptor would have looked like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_issues_in_Jurassic_Park#Velociraptor).

The funniest part of the day was when we went to the Ray Pool, where you can pat the sting rays. Rachael put her hand in to pat them without rolling up her jumper, so had a wet jumper arm for the rest of the morning. The sting rays themselves felt cool, really slippery kind of like moss.

The main show is no longer a water-ski show but jet-ski. They had some world-class guys doing some truly incredible tricks, such as doing about 8 back flips in a row from their own wake.

One thing that did make me sad though is that the only roller coaster they have was closed for maintenance. So we will just have to go to Movie World next time for the rides.
