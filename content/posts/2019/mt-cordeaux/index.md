A few guys from work and I did the Mount Cordeaux/Bare Rock track
in [Main Range National Park](https://parks.des.qld.gov.au/parks/main-range/about.html#tracks_from_cunninghams_gap).

Rachael and I had done the short Rainforest circuit at the start of the track on the way back from Boonah a few years ago. From here the hike up was mostly through rainforest and not to steep.

At Mt Cordeax there was a nice lookout back towards Lake Moogerah.

It then continues on a little bit further on Bare Rock track to another lookout.

It was a nice clear day so you could make out the Brisbane skyline reasonably clearly, although getting it to show up on a photo was harder.

It took us [about 2.5 hours](https://www.strava.com/activities/2285382444) return, and was a great short little hike to start off the weekend.
