Last night we went to Germany for some drinks for Steven's birthday and also because some people are going home soon. The bar in Waldshut that Steven and I found is even better than we first thought. Not only are beers only 2€, but if you start singing happy birthday then the bartender will come over with some free Jägermeister shots. Oh and rather than stealing the beer glass, Steven ASKED if he could keep it, and they even got him a clean one to take home.

Probably the best saying to learn in each language is "Cheers". Two important ones for Switzerland are Prost (German) and Santé (French). I haven't actually heard the Italian one yet, but apperntly it's "Salute". That's according to this site: [http://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/cheers.htm](http://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/cheers.htm)

Some other cool one's I have learnt from IAESTE people:
Na zdraví (Czech) Kippis (Finnish) Skål (Norwegian)

Anthony told me the Irish one last night as well, but I already forgot it. Possibly it was Sláinte as it says on the site. Have a look at how many different sayings they have listed for Irish. It's pretty clear it's not just a stereotype that they like to drink.
