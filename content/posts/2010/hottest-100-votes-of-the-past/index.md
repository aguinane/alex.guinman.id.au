As it comes once again to Hottest 100 voting time, this year I think I am unqualified to vote. Having been overseas for 6 months, I have not been keeping up with the music released in Australia and popular post-June. On the other hand I am happy that the list this year will provide me with lots of new music to listen to. But before I start to look at what I am going to vote for, I wanted to look back on what I voted for in the past. The first time I voted was in 2003, and my pick for number 1 was "I Love Work" although I was happy enough with Seven Nation Army and Hey Ya taking out the top 2 spots. In that year I didn't even use up the full 10 votes you are allowed, I think I only used 7. In years after that I took it much more seriously and always used my ten votes carefully.

So I am going to try and find copies of my lists from past years, although this could prove an impossible task. I posted my votes somewhere each year, but 6 years ago was before Facebook and the posts from my Myspace account are long since deleted. I will update this post then with my past votes as I find them (if I find them).

## 2006

- 'Til The End - The Living End
	Have to vote for Living End of course. They have had a song in the countdown since 1997. They were awesome live! Chose this song over Long Live The Weekend and Wake Up, also good songs.
- This Bed - Kisschasy
	There albulm actually came out like 2 years ago now I think, but anyway. It was in the list of songs you can vote for so why not. The shake was also on the list, but this is better.
- Call Me Anytime - The Cops
	Only just came out, so haven't given it a chance to get annoying yet, but so far I still love it.
- Don't You Think It's Time - Bob Evans
	This song sounds really nice, even if the Harmonica riff is a rip-off of a Billy Joel song. ALMOST voted for Nowhere Without You instead, another great song.
- Changing Emily - Special Patrol
	I really have no idea why I like this song. I just do.
- Distance - Ellington
	This vote is kinda a waste, cause they have no chance of getting in the list. But I love this song. It's Rohan's cousins band (he told me to download). There other EP songs are good too, but not as good as distance.
- Starlight - Muse
- Black Fingernails, Red Wine - Eskimo Joe
	Hmm, not there best album. But the chorus still makes this a good catchy song.
- Here It Goes Again - OK Go
	Perhaps not the greatest song in the world, but the video clip more than compensates for any doubt in whether it should get a vote.
- When You Were Young - The Killers
	Despite the fact that it was on Sarah's So Fresh CD, this is still a good song.
