Time to update this blog.

After my big night in Zurich, I stayed home most of Saturday, but went to the next town north in the afternoon (Brugg).

It was a lot bigger than I expected, certainly bigger than Turgi. Had a lot more shops and stuff, but nothing too exciting. There were some cool houses along the river.
